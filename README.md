-- MAGIC BUTTONS OVERVIEW --

Button 1 : 
I've chosen to do a UFO like effect. Changing the shape of the button itself with simple width, height and border-raidus manipulation. Also adding a neon glow effect for the text and box shadow and a rotate animation to give it that Unidentified Flying Object Vibe.


Button 2 : 
Trying something a bit more negative and not allowing anyone to actually choose this option cause - why not. Using a hover psuedo and using the translateX property and a little bit of style to avoid contact with the cursor. The only problem I ran into was setting the transition to be infinite so that you can't hover over it at all. The button will stop as soon as the translateX transition is complete which will then allow the user to hover over it


Button 3 :
This brings back the joy of buttons with a simple rainbow hover effect. Setting a background gradient and then changin the vertical width once the cursor hover over. Simple and effective.
